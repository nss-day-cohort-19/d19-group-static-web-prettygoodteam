					<h3>How does this work?</h3>
					<p>Playing with puppies is incredibly theraputic and has been shown to relieve stress and help stimulate a mindset of serenity. Wounded vets, the aged, people with disabilities, people with social anxiety, or those who just want to play with a puppy can benefit from the furry energy of one of our dogs. </p>

					<h4>Who may rent a puppy?</h4>
					<p>Most people are free to take a puppy home for the day once they have created a profile and passed the background check procedures we have in place. The welfare of these dogs is a chief priority and we want to make sure the people hanging out with them share that mindset.<br>Neither doggy eaters nor animal abusers are allowed to hang out with our pups. </p>

					<h4>How do I create a profile?</h4>
					<p>Great question! This process is super easy; simply fill out our <a href="#">profile application</a> and hit submit. We'll get your profile up and running as soon as the background check clears and you'll be all set to start browsing which puppy you want to hang out with!</p>


					<h4>What is involved in taking care of a puppy for the day?</h4>
					<p>Puppies require food and water when they are taking a break from all the fun they're having. Also, take them outside for bathroom breaks every few hours; they are going to use the bathroom either way and this will save you the mess.</p>
					<p>We provide everything else you'll need for your puppy playdate: toys, doggy carrier, food, food and water bowls, etc. We look forward to hearing how your day went!</p>

					<h4>What if the dog gets loose (ie. I lose the dog)?</h4>
					<p>This is not good. Dogs are like children, you shouldn't lose them. Too be fair, dogs are faster than kids. For this reason we have equipped all of our dogs with GPS trackers. If your pup gets away from you can track it on your phone with the <a href="#">free app</a> or gives us a call.</p>
